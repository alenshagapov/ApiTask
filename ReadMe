In this task, I didn't used Random User Api, because I saw this mark of the task too late, so I hope that it wasn't so principle. 
I wrote this task in INTELLIJ IDEA, so if you want to run this code, the easiest way, to take files from folder "web".
You should download all files(folder images also, because there all images), except of WEB-INF. 
To run code, you just need to open file index.jsp by google chrome.
P.S. all files should be in one directory or folder.
